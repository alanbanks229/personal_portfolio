                    <p>I am a full-stack engineer specializing in creating engaging digital experiences. I am currently seeking a position where I can leverage my background in communications, marketing, and product management to achieve impactful goals.

                        I spent the last few years at More Vang where I coded PDFs from scratch on a daily basis while overseeing the product team. Before that, I worked at Apple and managed a print shop. When I'm not writing code I can be found ouside enjoying nature or playing guitar in my basement.
