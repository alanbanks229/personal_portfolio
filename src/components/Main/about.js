                    <p>From a young age, I enjoyed singing, playing piano, and using technology to create interesting sounds with MIDI. While studying and creating music compositions in undergrad, there were numerous times I would look at a completed score and say "it's not done." I kept going deeper to find the details that contribute to the theme I was looking for in my pieces.</p>
                    <p>Having transitioned to code, the same mindset of finessing and perfecting doesn't stop. "Just because the code produces the right answer, it doesn't mean that it is optimal or efficient."</p>
                    <p>As an upcoming full-stack engineer my goal is to create engaging digital experiences. I am currently seeking a position where I can leverage my background in music, sports, and of course software-engineering to achieve impactful goals.</p>
